# apache-bank-api

Hello! My name is Arthur and I'm happy to introduce you to my ficticious online bank REST API, made with Java 8 and Spring Boot.
As you imagine the banks name is Apache Bank (:
This project is of intermediate level so if you're a begginer it's good to take a look at Boot Spring documentation, anyway, this can be a useful template for you.

Main Spring Boot implementations in this project:
* Validation;
* Ordenation;
* Pagination;
* Cache;
